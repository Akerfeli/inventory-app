# NestKeep
NestKeep is an inventory application for Android and iOS. In the app, the user can register their belongings and take note of where the item is placed, 
how many pieces of the item they have, and whether they need to buy more.

By keeping the information in the app updated, the user can save a lot of time and frustration by not having to search for those "I-know-I-have-one-but-where-did-I-put-it" items.
